# Raspberry-Pi-Flight-Tracker
My first self-directed Pi project, building a flight tracker for the SFO airport nearby.

Materials: Raspberry Pi Model B+, NooElec NESDR DVB-T USB stick, Wifi Dongle, FlightRadar24 membership.

PiMyLifeUp has a ton of great projects on their site, including the flight tracker: https://pimylifeup.com/raspberry-pi-flightradar24/

With this build, you'll be able to track nearby aircraft, and by sharing your tracking data with FlightRadar24, they'll give you a Business-level membership for free.
